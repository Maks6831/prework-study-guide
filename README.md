# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a simple webpage application that lets the end user know what I have learnt while complete the prework part of the coding bootcamp. The motivation was to acquire an understanding of what is involved in creating a webpage. I learn about the building blocks involved in front end web development as well how to use git to able to collaborate with others as well as learning about version control.


## Usage

The webpage consists of four main sections which are HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. Contained within each section are pointers on what a specific topics is, how is it used on an application and how to use it (generic commands etc.). In addition to this, the Javascript can be seen running on the DevTools console and lists all of the topics as well as choosing a random topic for you to learn.
